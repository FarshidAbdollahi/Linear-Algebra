- Null space calculation by the SVD;
- Calculation of the full SVD of a matrix;
- Calculation of the full QR decomposition of a matrix and inversion of a linear system by the QR decomposition approach (see [QR decomposition to solve linear systems in CUDA](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22399794/qr-decomposition-to-solve-linear-systems-in-cuda));
- Calculation of the LU decomposition of a matrix (see [LU Decomposition in CUDA](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22814040/lu-decomposition-in-cuda/28799239#28799239));
